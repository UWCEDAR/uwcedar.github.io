interest_statement: "Lisa is from Denver but has lived in Laramie for the past 10 years and works in the IT department at UW. She has a general interest in AI, machine learning and cybersecurity but would like to pear down those interests to find a focus as she continues her coursework. Lisa is having trouble finding a focus because she finds several general areas interesting, but is open to a variety of different projects."
