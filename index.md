The Computer Science department is launching a Cybersecurity education initiative to provide students access to in-demand, industry-relevant skills and knowledge within a rapidly growing field.Cybersecurity has been a national priority (officialy) for over a decade. President Obama has also identified it as one of our nations “most serious and national security challenges.” Since 2011, Governor Matt Mead has continuously affirmed the need for cybersecurity. The College of Engineering and Applied Science is supporting a faculty member and the development of a lab to support a cybersecurity initiative as part of the larger existing Tier-1 initiative.
