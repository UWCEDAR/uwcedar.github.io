# Welcome
The Computer Science department is launching a Cybersecurity education initiative to provide students access to in-demand, industry-relevant skills and knowledge within a rapidly growing field.Cybersecurity has been a national priority (officialy) for over a decade. President Obama has also identified it as one of our nations “most serious and national security challenges.” Since 2011, Governor Matt Mead has continuously affirmed the need for cybersecurity. The College of Engineering and Applied Science is supporting a faculty member and the development of a lab to support a cybersecurity initiative as part of the larger existing Tier-1 initiative.

# Overview
## The Cybersecurity Education and Research Initiative

The Cybersecurity Education and Research (CEDAR) initiative’s primary goal is to provide high-quality education, materials and support to advance Wyoming’s cybersecurity capabilities. The initiative relies on revamped collegiate-level security coursework that includes corporate and government partnerships, outreach, and university support. CEDAR will leverage partners externally (for real-world applications), and internal – such as College of Education Secondary Science/Math to develop K14 and general public outreach modules. CEDAR’s 18 month objectives include:

* Graduate at least five (5) Computer Science majors with a Cybersecurity concentration/certificate
* Establish a cutting edge virtualized Cybersecurity lab
* Achieve National Security Agency/Department of Homeland Security (NSA/DHS) Center of Academic Excellence designation
